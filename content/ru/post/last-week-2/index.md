This past week has been an interesting mix of relaxation, tech exploration, and social fun. Here's a glimpse into how it went down.

#### A River Journey with a View
Last weekend, I spent some quality time with my girlfriend on a river cruise along the Moscow River. Thereâ€™s something magical about seeing the city from the water, with the landmarks drifting by as we enjoyed the cool autumn breeze. It was a great way to escape the usual hustle and take in the beauty of Moscow from a different perspective.

#### Setting Up a VPS and Minecraft Server
On the tech side of things, I finally took the plunge and bought a VPS server in Germany. After setting up a VPN on the server for secure browsing, I decided to take it a step further and installed a Minecraft server. This was something I had been planning for a while so that my friends and I could have our own world to build and explore. It's been running smoothly so far, and I'm looking forward to our next big gaming session.

#### "Freshman Debut" and a Stop at "Dezhurnaya"
Midweek, I attended the "Freshman Debut" event at a local university. It was filled with energy and excitement as new students put on their first big performances. After the event, a group of us decided to keep the night going by heading to a cozy bar called "Dezhurnaya." Itâ€™s a bit of a hidden gem with a laid-back vibe â€“ the perfect place to unwind after a long day.

#### Billiards with Friends
I also managed to squeeze in a night of billiards with some friends. We hadnâ€™t played in a while, so it was fun to dust off our skills and have a bit of friendly competition. Thereâ€™s something satisfying about the clink of pool balls and the strategy behind each shot â€“ plus, it's always good for a laugh when someone accidentally sends a ball flying in the wrong direction.

#### Office Games: Perudo
To cap things off, we played a few rounds of "Perudo" at work with my colleagues. Itâ€™s a fun dice game that's perfect for unwinding after a busy day at the office. The mix of bluffing and chance always makes for an exciting (and sometimes frustrating) game. It's become a bit of a post-work tradition for us, and it's a great way to bond with the team outside of meetings and deadlines.

#### Wrapping Up
Looking back, itâ€™s been a week filled with balance â€“ from peaceful moments on the water to technical challenges and fun nights out with friends. Itâ€™s these diverse experiences that keep things exciting and remind me how important it is to make time for both work and play. Here's to more weeks like this!
