This past week was intense but rewarding, as it packed in six workdays and a few creative and social highlights. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how things unfolded.

#### Working on a Saturday

Normally, my workweek is five days, but this week was an exception as the government declared Saturday a working day. It was a tough push to keep up the pace for six consecutive days, especially given how packed each day was. But, as they say, "When the going gets tough, the tough get going!" Despite the additional workload, I managed to make some solid progress on my projects.

#### Mapping Bank System Interactions

One of the key projects I tackled was designing a detailed interaction map for our bank‚Äôs systems with the systems of our subsidiary organizations. Visualizing these connections helped bring clarity to complex relationships and made the overall system structure easier to understand for the team. It felt satisfying to see the intricate web of connections drawn out, knowing it would help streamline our workflows.

#### Building the Longest Railroad in Minecraft

In my downtime, I took on a fun challenge in Minecraft: building the longest railroad I‚Äôve ever constructed in the game! The process was both meditative and ambitious, but the feeling of finally seeing it come together was worth it. It became a reminder that sometimes, big tasks‚Äîwhether virtual or real‚Äîjust need patience and a steady pace.

#### Attending the ‚ÄúNatal Chart‚Äù Event

This week also brought some intriguing moments outside of work. The student committee at my faculty organized an event called the "Natal Chart," where we explored astrological charts and discussed the idea of destiny from an interesting, lighthearted perspective. It was a unique experience that brought people together and let us explore a topic that‚Äôs both fun and thought-provoking.

#### The Premiere of ‚ÄúVenom: The Last Dance‚Äù

To wrap up the week, I caught the premiere of *Venom: The Last Dance*. The theater buzzed with energy as fans gathered for this highly anticipated release. The film was filled with action and suspense, and it made for a perfect way to unwind after such a packed schedule.
